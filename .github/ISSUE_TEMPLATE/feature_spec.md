## Feature Intent

## SpecDD Architecture Alignment (Drift Control)
Please confirm that this feature respects the global `mitm-2` constraints defined in `.sdd` files:
- [ ] **Architecture:** The layered architecture is maintained (no direct bypass from Collector to Delivery).
- [ ] **Security:** Envelope Encryption (AES-GCM) is NOT bypassed for PII data.
- [ ] **Data Model:** Core PostgreSQL schemas remain intact (feature-specific tables are allowed).
- [ ] **Standards:** SPDX headers, English documentation, and independent `go.mod` per layer will be maintained.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
